 Wrox Early Adopter VoiceXML Code Samples
==========================================

Welcome to the code download for Wrox Early Adopter VoiceXML. 10 subdirectories should have been created, one for each chapter in the book that contains workable VoiceXML examples (that is, chapters 1 through 10).

Where appropriate, certain sample code from the text has been incorporated into a complete VoiceXML application so that it may be run on a voice gateway. Similarly, in some cases, code is provided in an incomplete form and will not run as is. This code is included for reference, and to be copied into your own applications.

For some chapters, namely 7 and 9, additional information is provided in the chapter directory for setting up additional software components required by the sample applications. These files are called "chapter 7 readme.txt", and "chapter 9 readme.htm" respectively.
